      <description>Containers Orchestration Author : Ahmed Ayman
What is container orchestration ? Well, imagine you have an app that works with 3 containers for example back-end, front-end, database, when you deploy this application you can&amp;rsquo;t just work with one instance of each container on 1 server. Because if there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of traffic coming one server won&amp;rsquo;t be enough to process them at the same time, and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a dead server.</description>

The Desired State What does that even mean ? well, let&amp;rsquo;s think of k8s as a genie, we wish and desire things and he makes sure it happens.
So, the desired state is a manifest written by the administrator (or k8s user at this case) to tell k8s exactly the state that we want the application to be in at all times, for example .</description>

Can you spot the problem ? PODS GETS CREATED AND DESTROYED ALL THE TIME!
How can we we count on there IP addresses, also how can we communicate with all the the pods of the same kind at once ?
The Solution : K8s Services One of the best features Kubernetes offers is that non-functioning pods get replaced by new ones automatically. however these new pods have a different set of IPs.</description>
